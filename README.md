# Online Judge

Online Judge is a web-based platform to solve and practice out algorithmic problems. Users can submit their code, which is then automatically evaluated as accepted or not accepted against predefined test cases. This project aims to facilitate algorithm practice for users of all skill levels. You can also use the Online Judge application for free [[Click here]](https://www.online-judge-for-all.icu/) and can also check out all the codes used to built this web application from my github repository.
